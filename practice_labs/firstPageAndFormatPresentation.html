I love to cook as it keeps me stress free and helps me keep my mind active, so it's became my hobby. It is one of those things that just comes naturally for me, and I think I inherited, because I can cook almost anything on the first try, much like my mother. 
<blockquote>
I highly recommend everyone to try cooking as a hobby. 
    <blockquote>
      The reason I recommend cooking as a hobby is because it doesn’t require “special” tools and it doesn’t cause a lot of problems physically. It will give loads of fun and family will eat healthier because of it.

One more hobbies is hiking.
	I love to carry my backpack with some fruits, water and walk around mountains and valleys while the fresh air recharges the lungs, and spending time in nature lets me step back and enjoy the little things.
