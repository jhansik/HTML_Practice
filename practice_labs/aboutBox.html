<h1>Short Term Goal</h1>
<p>
	My short term goal is to work in a organisation where I can make the best use of my skills and knowledge.
<br>
The last five years of my career, I've concentrated on learning and acquiring all the skills needed to perform excellent work. Sometimes i will deviate from my goals due to busy schedule and lack of motivation. But,  I am working to prepare myself for good opportunities in the future by practising everyday. I want to find a position where I can contribute what I've learned through my experience.  I believe the next couple of months will be very important to me and my immediate goal is to learn and become skilled in all aspects of Software technologies.

<h2>Long Term Goal</h2>
<p>
My long term goal is to become a self dependent person in terms of money, status so that I can earn a good position and respect in society. 
<br>
I have learned that long-term goals are best achieved when I break them into shorter goals. My short-term goal is to find a position that will put me in a forward-moving company with solid performance and future projections. As part of a team, I want to add value and continue to grow the company. My long-term goal will depend on how i perform in that position. My plan is to move into a position of responsibility where I can play a key role.
