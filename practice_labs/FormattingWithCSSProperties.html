Tennis is one of the most popular individual sports in the world. In tennis the player uses a racquet to hit a ball over a net into the opponents court. The ball must be kept in play and can only bounce one time on the court surface before the opponent must strike the ball back over the net. The standard ball is made up of felt over hollow rubber. An early version of Tennis started out in the 16th century in France where players would yell "tenez" when starting a game giving the game the name Tennis. Later the game would be refined in England in the 19th century as lawn tennis to more resemble the sport we play today.

Tennis is often played with one player per side (singles) or with two players per side (doubles). The scores starts with love which means 0. If the people on both sides had zero like at the beginning of the game you would say love all which means 0 all. Then it goes 15, 30,40,game.There are six games in a set, three sets in a match. A game starts with the server the one whose wins the toss. When you serve the key is your throw. The throw must be perfect. You do not step over the baseline which is the furthest line on the court. You try to get the ball in the server box. If you were serving and you were on the right side of the court, your shoulders would face the left side of the court and you would serve to the other box on the other side of the net. If you end up hitting the net during a serve you get another try. The two main swings in tennis are the backhand and forehand.
