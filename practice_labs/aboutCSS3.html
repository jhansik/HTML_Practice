	<h2>India says national flags must fly at universities</h2>
	<p style="text-align:center;">India has made it mandatory for central universities across the country to fly the national flag on their campuses. </p><br>
		<p>The decision to fly the flag was taken at a meeting of Human Resources Development <br>
			Minister Smriti Irani and vice-chancellors of central universities on Thursday.</p>
	<p> The first flag will come up in Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), which has been rocked by protests since last week.</p>

Students in JNU are angry over the arrest of their union leader Kanhaiya Kumar on sedition charges. Mr Kumar was arrested after a rally last week against the 2013 hanging of Mohammed Afzal Guru at which anti-India slogans were allegedly raised. Afzal Guru was convicted over a 2001 plot to attack India's parliament - charges he always denied. The attack was carried out by Kashmiri militants and left 14 people dead.
A spokesman announced that the flag would be put up "proudly and prominently" at a central place in the university.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this is good decision as "Putting up the 207-foot (63m) flag would 'evoke nationalistic sentiments' in the students and The flag will symbolise the unity and integrity of the nation, under which higher education would flourish" </p>
