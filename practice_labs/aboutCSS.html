	<b>Apple iPhone 6S Plus</b>
	<br>
Apple's larger model has had a chance to find its feet, updated in the iPhone 6S Plus to mirror the updates brought to the regular iPhone 6S. That brings you the advantage of a 3D Touch display, with more methods of interaction, a faster Touch ID experience, backed by faster hardware.If you're looking for a larger iPhone, then the 6S Plus is where you need to look. Some might say that by the time you reach 5.5-inches, the Full HD display isn't as sharp as some rivals. That's the case with the 6S too, but here there's the slight feeling that Apple isn't offering more features through that large display, as you might find in a Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+, for example.You do get a new camera experience, however, and this model also sports optical image stabilisation, along with new 4K video capture and Live Photos, making for one of the slickest camera experiences around.

	<b>Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+</b> <br>
The Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ takes one of 2015's most innovative models and expands it. Swelling the edge+ up to 5.7-inches over the original 5.1, it's a leap forward in screen size, even if much of the specification remains the same. For many, with the absence of the Note 5, it's the S6 edge+ that takes all the glory in the big screen stakes. The Samsung Galaxy S6 family offers some of the best camera performance around and that's repeated on the S6 edge+, combined with a great fingerprint scanner and some innovative features in those curved display edges.

<b>HTC One A9</b><br>
The HTC One A9 might be best known for its closeness to the iPhone 6 in design, but there's a lot about this phone to love. It runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow, with a stripped down version of HTC Sense, resulting in a lovely overall experience, full of refinement.The design is great, it feels lovely in the hand and surprisingly, the performance is very good for a handset that has mid-range hardware.The AMOLED display is great and there's an improved camera that beats that of the M9, although it still struggles in low light conditions. There is also an excellent fingerprint scanner.
