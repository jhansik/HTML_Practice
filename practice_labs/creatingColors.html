	Zomato is a restaurant search and discovery website.I think they've done an awesome job making a product that would meet all standards.Below are few things i like in this site .
</p>
<p align="left">
	
	- The city selection drop-down placed at a prominent spot. This used to be different - they seem to have done some iterations / AB testing and decided on this<br>
	- Thought put behind the user needs (for example, people are much likelier to select a location close by, rather than filter by cuisine - so location comes before cuisine)<br>
	- The page looks pretty - large pictures of appetising food<br>
	- The language of the page is informal all over - makes the page welcoming.<br>
	- Predictive drop-downs<br>
	- Moving on to the search results page<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important information is presented clearly (cost for 2, timings, rating, etc). There is enough whitespace to make it look not cluttered. The ads are a little distracting and take away from the appeal of the page, but they are location-specific.<br>
<br>
And so on, throughout their site, they've managed to keep it user-friendly. Zomato has a beautiful app for smartphones and tablets.

Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation(IRCTC) website for booking train tickets in India. The website has some problems and below are the few thing i dislike about this site. 
</p>
<p align="left">
	- The site is quite content heavy. It will take a considerable amount of time for logging in, especially in the morning time. In fact, it is heavy because of the number of advertisements displayed on it.<br>
	- Even though the booking time under Tatkal quota has been reduced to 24-hours, but logging in the IRCTC website during the early morning hours is simply next to impossible.<br>
	- The site is not optimized for all types of internet connections, so irrespective of your connection speed, it will be difficult to effectively ‘search,’ book or cancel tickets. By the time you clear the log-in hurdles and reach the final step to book a ticket, you will have probably missed out the available seats.<br>
	- It takes a lot of time to fill up the information like 'To' and 'From' information and then viewing the trains available etc and if you successfully manage to log-in and fill up the form, by then safely expect the tickets to be 'sold out'. They are not retaining basic pre-filled information for each login.<br>
