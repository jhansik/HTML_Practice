	Instructions followed for this page: 
The circle is not full (only partial can be half or 3/4) and is in the center. So there is a box at the bottom that covers a part of the circle (position). Fill different colors around and inside the circle (gradient). When hovering the circle, it expands into a rounded box (the shadow of the circle remains the same). So inside the circle it's a background image of any place. While the circle expands, 2 texts appear and are dispalyed in the appropriate positions (use pseudo-elements and position property). When hovering the bottom part, the decription of the place is displayed and the circle should expand. When moving the mouse out, the text disappears, but the circle should be in expanded position. Do not use transform and animation. The only thing allowed to use is transition because there's no animation at all.</p></div>
